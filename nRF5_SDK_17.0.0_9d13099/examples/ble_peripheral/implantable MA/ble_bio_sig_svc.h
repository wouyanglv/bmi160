 * @ingroup ble_sdk_srv
 * @brief Heart Rate Service module.
 *
 * @details This module implements the Heart Rate Service with the Heart Rate Measurement,
 *          Body Sensor Location and Heart Rate Control Point characteristics.
 *          During initialization it adds the Heart Rate Service and Heart Rate Measurement
 *          characteristic to the BLE stack database. Optionally it also adds the
 *          Body Sensor Location and Heart Rate Control Point characteristics.
 *
 *          If enabled, notification of the Heart Rate Measurement characteristic is performed
 *          when the application calls ble_hrs_heart_rate_measurement_send().
 *
 *          The Heart Rate Service also provides a set of functions for manipulating the
 *          various fields in the Heart Rate Measurement characteristic, as well as setting
 *          the Body Sensor Location characteristic value.
 *
 *          If an event handler is supplied by the application, the Heart Rate Service will
 *          generate Heart Rate Service events to the application.
 *
 * @note    The application must register this module as BLE event observer using the
 *          NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER macro. Example:
 *          @code
 *              ble_hrs_t instance;
 *              NRF_SDH_BLE_OBSERVER(anything, BLE_HRS_BLE_OBSERVER_PRIO,
 *                                   ble_hrs_on_ble_evt, &instance);
 *          @endcode
 *
 * @note Attention!
 *  To maintain compliance with Nordic Semiconductor ASA Bluetooth profile
 *  qualification listings, this section of source code must not be modified.
